# hello-world
This is my first attempt at making a repository on GitHub.
I wote a marvelous piece on here about myself, but i accedentially hit a combination 
of keys that refreshed the webpage before i was finished, and as you probably guessed, it's gone.
But what harm it was fun, kind of dissapointed. I'll come back to re-do it soon.
